So, here’s the story of how I built my first system. Someone close to me came up and said, "Hey, I need an e-commerce website." Now, I know there are tons of tools out there that could make this super quick, but guess what? I decided to go all in and build it from scratch. Let me tell you how it went.

## The Stack I Used

- **Frontend & Backend**: I went with Next.js because it’s awesome! I used server actions and Supabase to handle the database stuff.
- **Database Design**: I created tables for products, users, orders… you name it. I connected them using foreign keys so everything works like magic. For example, when someone adds something to their cart, I can fetch the exact data for that cart. Pretty neat, huh?
- **Hosting**: Right now, it’s on Vercel’s free hosting. But we’ve got plans to scale and even buy a proper domain later.
- **Payments**: For payment processing, I used Paystack. It’s reliable and does the job well.

## Planning for Scaling

Here’s the fun part. I didn’t just stop at making the website work. I thought about the future! What if the business grows? I designed the system to be ready for scaling.

- **Availability**: The site is built to always be available. Downtime? No, thank you.
- **Partition Resistance**: I worked to minimize this as much as possible. We’re keeping things smooth.
- **Load Balancers**: I planned for adding these in the future. When traffic goes crazy, load balancers will keep everything running without breaking a sweat.

## What’s Next?

Right now, the site is live, and I’m excited about how it turned out. The site will be going live in two weeks when the business launches. Building it from scratch taught me so much, and I’m ready to see it grow. If you’ve got a project in mind, just dive in. Who knows? You might surprise yourself too.

Let’s keep building cool stuff!
