# Breaking into Tech: The Journey So Far!

Welcome to my first ever blog, wow, it's been a long time coming. Bruh tech is hard! The constant learning can be overwhelming. Sometimes, I ask myself if I made a mistake. I studied Industrial Relations and Personnel Management, finishing third in my class, and had a clear, easy career path ahead. But deep down, I felt like I was made for more and give more. Enough about me—let’s dive into what I’ve learned so far on this tech journey.

### 1. Not a Quick Money Scheme:
If you’re trying to get into tech because you think you’ll be earning in dollars in just a few months, please reconsider. I’m not saying it’s impossible, but this industry is demanding. You’ve got to enjoy the work; otherwise, burnout is inevitable.

### 2. Imposter Syndrome:
This is real, man! The constant feeling of not being good enough, or thinking that other devs are way better, can weigh you down. How I got past this was simple: keep going and keep learning. The more knowledge you gain and apply, the more gratifying it is, and your confidence will grow.

### 3. Continuous Learning:
Oh boy, this is the toughest part. For example, a tutorial on **Next.js 14** could have over **200 videos**. That’s just for one framework! The learning never stops in tech, but that’s part of what keeps it exciting.

### 4. Huge Paycheck:
On average, tech professionals in Africa can earn between **$1,000 - $5,000** per month depending on their skill level and job role. But it takes time, effort, and lots of learning to reach that level.

### 5. Solving Problems:
This is the best part of being in the tech industry! The ability to help businesses and individuals solve complex problems is what motivates me. Every solution I create is a step towards making someone's life easier.

### Conclusion:
The tech journey is not for the faint-hearted. It demands patience, continuous learning, and perseverance. You’ll face imposter syndrome, feel overwhelmed, and doubt your decisions at times. But the satisfaction of solving real-world problems and the potential for high earnings makes the journey worth it. So, if you're diving into tech, buckle up for the ride of a lifetime!
